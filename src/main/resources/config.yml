#Little headsup before you think of using php. For now its only Windows and if/when you do enable it Nginx and php will run.
#Tho to get access to the website (directly from php) you need to use "ServerIP:phpport" You can go thru to do this with nginx
#So it's "ServerIP:listningport"
#Webserver configuration
listeningport: 25567 #Is used for both php webserver and html.
listeningportssl: 25568
phpport: 25569 #Used for FastCGI to allow PHP code execution. This is later used in the nginx.conf file.
EnableWebserver: true #This should always be on.
ServerIP: localhost #this is used for php ip.
#Only enable if I ask you to.
debug: false

#DO NOT HAVE BOTH HTML AND PHP AT TRUE AT ONCE!
UseHtml: true
UsePHP: false

EnableSSL: false #This can be used. but there is no guarantee that it will work.

#Everything is case sensitive.
SSLJKSName: "YourName" #Without the .jks
SSLJKSPass: "Yourpass"
SSLJKSKey: "Yourkey"
###To create an .jks key follow this

###Be sure you do it right otherwise it wont work!

#DO NOT IN ANY WAY EDIT THIS
